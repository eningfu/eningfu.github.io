           I haven't been drawing as much as i used to as i don't seem to
           have any inspiration. However, I sometimes doodle in MsPaint, which
           is a pretty good tool as it prevents me from being a perfectionist.
           <br>
           I've had several comic and animation ideas but I have never carried them
           out.

            Whenever I get sick of drawing, i turn to producing some music. I have a lot 
            of unfinished tracks, mostly lacking vocals. Most of these were created for 
            a character or scene in my stories, but a couple are actual songs.

            I'm an okay writer, i think. I create worlds for my characters to live in, and
            give them all a role to play. Sometimes, a certain song will act as the inspiration.
            I have plenty of unfinished projects... If only I could just settle on one idea.
